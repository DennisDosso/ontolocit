# ontolocit
Directory where I put things related to ontologies about data citation

### Files that you find here
* The files called ontology are the same citation graph ontology, only codified using different syntaxes (here I chose turtle and OWL/XML, which should be enough to re-build the ontology in every other syntax).
* A PDF with the graphic representation of the ontology.
